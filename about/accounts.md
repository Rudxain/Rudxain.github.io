# Accounts
This page has 2 purposes:
- Show my contact info
- Deter impersonators

If you find a user claiming to be me, but their account doesn't match anything here, it's extremely likely they are lying. My emails and phones are private, to reduce spam.

### Sub
- [YT channel](https://youtube.com/@Rudxain). I registered [my custom URL](https://youtube.com/c/RFSGameplayer) when requisites were lower, now I can't update/remove it ðŸ’€. I didn't even upload "gameplays"/"let's plays", I just *planned* to do so.

## Lost
- Google+. Because it died with the social media, lol.
- Frikipedia. Because it died with the website. R.I.P. both.
- Cartoon Network. I had many accounts because I was a kid and I always forgot my password, lol. I liked to play as a "toonix" and playing Flash games like the one inspired by "How To Train Your Dragon". I never deleted any of the accounts, but I added it to this list because I forgor ðŸ’€ the usernames too, LMAO.
- Club Penguin. I don't even remember if I registered ðŸ’€.

## Deleted
- Facebook. Usernames (sorted from oldest to newest): faladagron, faladragon, Bitscardo, RFSgp, RicardoFSerrata, RicardoFernandezSerrata, Rudxain. I only had 1 account, I never forgot the password (unlike other people, lol)
- Instagram. I had many usernames because I **deleted it 3 or 4 times**
- Twitter. It was boring circa ~2016, now it became corrupted by greed (Elon Musk)
- SoundCloud: `rfs-680354630`. I thought I wouldn't need it, because I never uploaded audio
- NewGrounds: `RFS-Gamer`
- Duolingo. I liked it, and completed the full English & Spanish courses with max scores. I learned some Greek, Latin, Esperanto, Portuguese, Japanese Hiragana, Chinese Mandarin, Italian, French, and German. But I forgot about most of them, lol.
- Desmos. Saving projects on the cloud is useful, but I realized I don't need it. I prefer WolframAlpha
- Samsung. I just wanted a dark theme on my Galaxy J3 Mission (it had Android 8), so I installed the most "vanilla"/"faithful" theme (I don't remember the name, but it was "high contrast")
- Canva. It became useless.
- Adobe. They're like Apple, but worse.
- AI Dungeon. They made it worse. IDK if it's better now
- [SayMine](https://saymine.com). I discovered this one thanks to ThioJoe. It's useless for me, because I rarely get mails, lol
