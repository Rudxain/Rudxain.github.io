# Rudxain @ GH Pages

My username literally means "red & cyan", which are the non-grayscale colors in my isotype (AKA "logo").

## I...

- reply/react to posts regardless of their ⌛date (I'm "ancient-agnostic", lol). [I'm kind of a historian/paleontologist myself](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FFcEIG5WQAgBo33.jpg) XD .
- **❤LOVE** 🎵music mashups! If you've seen my YT and SC playlists, you'll know I'm **very** serious.
- hate hypocrisy, even my own (if I ever become unintentionally hypocrite).
- like learning, and am skeptical of myself. So I'll admit being wrong, if I recognize that I'm wrong, and I'll try my best to find flaws in my reasoning. I'll also thank anyone who corrects me (properly and respectfully).
- am an atheist open to beliefs (as long as they're rational).
- am skeptic, that is, I'm skeptic of **myself**, other people, and the environment. Fake skeptics are *not skeptical of themselves*, they won't accept constructive criticism from anyone.
- like Greek & Hinduism lore, despite not believing those.
- have the creativity to think about new beliefs, like the "Universe = Dead Deity" hypothesis, and the hypothesis that "deities may exist but none created our universe".
- am not agnostic, because I don't assume that deities are the only kind of transcendental thing that could exist.
- think religion should be treated like art/entertainment, not a mindset, not a lifestyle.
- am an 🍎Apple Boycotter. Even if I were rich, I **wouldn't buy a single product** from them, unless I'm *forced* to.
- think abortion should be replaced by adoption. If you ban adoption, you can't ban abortion, otherwise you're a clown 🤡. "pro-life" usually means "pro-birth". The majority doesn't care about the baby's life, they just want it to be born, peak hypocrisy.
- think humanity is not **mature** (lol) enough for abortion, because some people may abuse the law, and others will harass the people who don't abuse.
- am anti-sexist. ♀️Feminism is just ♂️Machismo for girls. I agree that gender differences shouldn't be ignored, but that doesn't mean we should do unnecessary discrimination. There's good and bad discrimination, learn the difference, be wiser.
- am anti-racist, but I like some racist jokes, even if it "offends my race".
- am partially vegan, consuming animal-based products as least as possible.
- **recycle almost anything**, as much as possible. However, that may be bad for my health, because I do it with water bottles, so I may be ingesting nano-plastics 😥. I hope graphene becomes mainstream sooner.
- love minimalism, hate redundancy (except when it's truly necessary)

## Accounts

- Google/Gmail
- Microsoft/Outlook
- [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/RFSGameplayer). My custom URL has "RFSGameplayer" because I changed it long ago when YT requisites were lower, now I can't update it to Rudxain lol. I didn't even upload "gameplays" or "let's plays", I just *planned* to do so.
- I have WhatsApp, but I don't want my personal phone number to be public. I'm considering switching to Telegram
- [Newgrounds user page](https://Rudxain.newgrounds.com)
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Rudxain)
- [GitHub repos](https://github.com/Rudxain?tab=repositories) & [Gists](https://gist.github.com/Rudxain)
- [Soundcloud profile](https://soundcloud.com/Rudxain)
- [Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search](https://www.mersenne.org) (my user ID is private, and AFAIK my profile has no URL). I used to grind CPUs with Prime95, hoping to get some money, or at least help humanity get better cryptographic security
- [My Llamalab Automate](https://llamalab.com/automate/community/flows/42921) user ID is #34225, a [JSON containing IDs of all my flows](https://llamalab.com/automate/community/api/v1/users/34225/flows) is available. When I'm not coding JS or some shell lang, I use AM because it offers fast and easy access to Android system APIs. I usually don't automate stuff because I would rather do some stuff manually than to have a background process always consuming the little RAM my device has
- Samsung (I just wanted themes for my Galaxy lol)
- [Roblox profile (RFS_Roblox)](https://www.roblox.com/users/323158352/profile). I only played with my siblings, and I created my account before inventing the "Rudxain" username/alias.
- [TotalJerkFace/FancyForce profile (RFSwerewolf)](https://totaljerkface.com/profile.tjf?uid=6050400). I played Happy Wheels a lot back in the day. My username was inspired by "The Werehog" from the game Sonic Unleashed (very underrated Sega game)
- My Boomlings/RobTop-Games username is "Rudxain" (it was "RFS", before I changed it, now [someone else](https://gdbrowser.com/u/RFS) has that name). [My Geometry Dash profile](https://gdbrowser.com/u/Rudxain). I didn't had the chance to play Boomlings, but I knew about the game before RobTop removed it from G Play Store, all thanks to GD.
- [osu! (RFS_Osu)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9905562). I guess you'll start seeing a pattern here, I **LOVE** music/rhythm games. 1 of my faves isn't mentioned on this list [(Music Racer)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abstractart.music_racer), but I stopped playing it
- My Supercell ID is "Rudxain", and my name in Brawl Stars is "Rudxain null", because apparently "Rudxain" is an *"invalid name"* but **"null" is perfectly valid** according to Supercell. I created my ID because I kinda like Brawl Stars, and I play it with my siblings. I sometimes played Clash of Clans in the past, but played as guest
- [SayMine](https://saymine.com). I discovered this one thanks to ThioJoe. It's kinda useless for me because I almost never get any mail, lol

- Instagram. I had many usernames because I **deleted it 3 or 4 times**

- Newgrounds (RFS-Gamer)
- G+, because it died with the social media
- Frikipedia, also because my account died with the website itself lol

I liked to play as a "toonix" and playing Flash games like the one inspired by "How To Train Your Dragon". I never deleted any of the accounts, but I added it to this list because I forgor 💀 the usernames too LMAO
