# Accounts
* Google/Gmail
* Microsoft/Outlook
* [YouTube channel (Rudxain)](https://www.youtube.com/c/RFSGameplayer)
* I have WhatsApp, but I don't want my personal phone number to be public. I'm considering switching to Telegram
* [Newgrounds user page](https://Rudxain.newgrounds.com)
* [GitHub repos](https://github.com/Rudxain?tab=repositories) & [Gists](https://gist.github.com/Rudxain)
* [Soundcloud profile](https://soundcloud.com/Rudxain)
* [Cymatics](https://cymatics.fm) (I don't know my "ID" because IIRC it depends on my Google account or email)
* [Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search](https://www.mersenne.org) (my user ID is private, and AFAIK my profile has no URL). I used to grind CPUs with Prime95, hoping to get some money, or at least help humanity get better cryptographic security
* My [Llamalab Automate](https://llamalab.com/automate) user ID is #34225. When I'm not coding JS or some shell lang, I use AM because it offers fast and easy access to Android system APIs. I usually don't automate stuff because I would rather do some stuff manually than to have a background process always consuming the little RAM my device has
* Samsung (I just wanted themes for my Galaxy lol)
* [Roblox profile (RFS_Roblox)](https://www.roblox.com/users/323158352/profile). I only played with my siblings, and I created my account before inventing the "Rudxain" username/alias.
* [TotalJerkFace/FancyForce profile (RFSwerewolf)](https://totaljerkface.com/profile.tjf?uid=6050400). I played Happy Wheels a lot back in the day. My username was inspired by "The Werehog" from the game Sonic Unleashed (very underrated Sega game)
* My Boomlings/RobTop Games ID is "Rudxain" (it was "RFS", before I changed it). I didn't had the chance to play Boomlings, but I knew about the game before RobTop removed it from G Play Store, all thanks to Geometry Dash. I forgot my user ID, because RT made it private to reduce the probability of being hacked
* [osu! (RFS_Osu)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9905562). I guess you'll start seeing a pattern here, I **LOVE** music/rhythm games. 1 of my faves isn't mentioned on this list [(Music Racer)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abstractart.music_racer), but I stopped playing it
* My Supercell ID is "Rudxain", and my name in Brawl Stars is "Rudxain null", because apparently "Rudxain" is an *"invalid name"* but **"null" is perfectly valid** according to Supercell. I created my ID because I kinda like Brawl Stars, and I play it with my siblings. I sometimes played Clash of Clans in the past, but played as guest

## Sub-accounts

# Deleted accounts
* Facebook. I had 2 usernames, 1 contained the word "dragon" (old) and the other was "rudxain" I guess. I only had 1 FB account, I never forgot the password lol
* Instagram. I had many usernames because I **deleted it 3 or 4 times**
* Twitter. It was boring
* Duolingo. I liked it, and completed the full English & Spanish courses with high scores. I learned some Greek, Latin, Esperanto, Portuguese, Japanese Hiragana, Chinese Mandarin, Italian, French, and German. But I forgot about most of them lol
* Desmos. Having the ability to save any project on the cloud is very useful, but I realized I don't need it that much
* Adobe. They're like Apple, but worse
* Newgrounds (RFS-Gamer)
* G+, because it died with the social media
* Frikipedia, also because my account died with the website itself lol
