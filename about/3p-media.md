### Games
> This category includes any interactive AV media

**UNDERTALE** & `deltarune` are my beloved. I've only played their demos, but I've watched playthroughs of the complete versions, and read/listen to lots of fan theories. I'm mostly invested in the plot and lore, but the music is peak as well, and chapter4's dark-world is so beautiful! I love the community, despite its flaws, because we're all human. I plan to buy both games (to support Toby Fox and his team), then play all DR chapters on my own.

[_"Her Tears Were My Light"_](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nomnomnami.hertearsweremylight&hl=en) is, I'd say, the best (interactive) visual-novel I've experienced.

[_DATA WING_](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DanVogt.DATAWING&hl=en) is **criminally underrated**. That game is such a banger. The controls are somewhat confusing, but the story and visuals are so good! There's also LORE?! yes, there is!

Geometry Dash is the only game I still play (occasionally) to this day, ever since the v1.9 days. I love rhythm games, especially when they include visuals that match the music. However, platformer mode is also good! The community and RobTop have achieved amazing things.

_Sonic Unleashed_ was a big part of my childhood, as it was the only SEGA game I had access to, and my PS2 library was relatively small (approx a dozen games). I remember getting to EggmanLand, but not Dark Gaia. I had lots of fun playing it with my siblings. We had to keep the console turned on because we didn't have a MemoryCard™ for a while. We got good at speedrunning the game, because we had to turn off the PS2 to save energy.

Gameplay isn't the only thing that's underrated about Sonic Unleashed, the OST is a banger!

_"Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks"_ was yet another PS2 game that I remember fondly. I played it with friends and siblings.

ATV4, deserves an honorable mention. It was a racing game with gameplay variety. But most importantly, it had really funny (and accurate) ragdoll physics!

From the GTA saga, I've played:
- Vice City. Almost finished it!
- Liberty City. Only a negligible part.
- San Andreas. Mostly.
- V. A lil bit.

Last but not least, this section wouldn't be complete without Minecraft. It's also a game I played with friends and siblings, but I've enjoyed it on my own. The 1st version I've actually played was 1.8 (demo). I've played older versions with mods, and newer versions as vanilla. I've never (legitimately) beaten the game, on any version 💀

### Anime & Cartoons
The only anime I've ever finished was [BNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNA:_Brand_New_Animal). The show still has a place in my heart despite being a bit rushed in the last 3 (4?) episodes.

I did watch many episodes from the following:
- The Dragon Ball saga
- Death Note
- Naruto saga (not including Boruto)
- Sword Art Online

> TO-DO: mention the other morbillion animated shows that aren't japanese anime

## Audio
For audio-only art, most of my favorites are music. Listen to my playlists (there's wildly different genres):
- [YT](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUryK3zza2ScWOhbd__X4Ne0xC6TlKiiH)
- [SC](https://soundcloud.com/rudxain/sets/music-playlist)

However, there might be something that isn't music, but it still deserves a spotlight, I don't remember what
