- [osu! (RFS_Osu)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9905562)
- My Supercell ID is "Rudxain", and my name in Brawl Stars is "Rudxain null", because apparently "Rudxain" is an *"invalid name"* but **"null" is perfectly valid** according to Supercell. I created my ID because I kinda like Brawl Stars, and I played it with my siblings. I sometimes played Clash of Clans in the past, but played as guest.

### Sub
- [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@Rudxain). [My custom URL](https://youtube.com/c/RFSGameplayer) has "RFSGameplayer" because I changed it long ago when YT requisites were lower, now I can't update it to Rudxain, lol (but I have it as a handle now!). I didn't even upload "gameplays" or "let's plays", I just *planned* to do so

## Deleted
- Google+. Because it died with the social media, lol
- Facebook. Usernames (sorted from oldest to newest): faladagron, faladragon, Bitscardo, RFSgp, RicardoFSerrata, RicardoFernandezSerrata, Rudxain. I only had 1 account, I never forgot the password (unlike other people, lol)
- Instagram. I had many usernames because I **deleted it 3 or 4 times**
- Twitter. It was boring circa ~2016, now it became corrupted by greed (Elon Musk)
- Duolingo. I liked it, and completed the full English & Spanish courses with max scores. I learned some Greek, Latin, Esperanto, Portuguese, Japanese Hiragana, Chinese Mandarin, Italian, French, and German. But I forgot about most of them, lol.
- Desmos. Saving projects on the cloud is useful, but I realized I don't need it. I prefer WolframAlpha
- Samsung. I just wanted a dark theme on my Galaxy J3 Mission (it had Android 8), so I installed the most "vanilla"/"faithful" theme (I don't remember the name, but it was "high contrast")
- Adobe. They're like Apple, but worse
- SoundCloud (rfs-680354630). I thought I wouldn't need it, because I never uploaded audio
- Newgrounds (RFS-Gamer)
- Frikipedia. Because it died with the website. R.I.P. both
- Cartoon Network. I had many accounts because I was a kid and I always forgot my password, lol. I liked to play as a "toonix" and playing Flash games like the one inspired by "How To Train Your Dragon". I never deleted any of the accounts, but I added it to this list because I forgor 💀 the usernames too, LMAO
- AI Dungeon. They made it worse. IDK if it's better now
- [SayMine](https://saymine.com). I discovered this one thanks to ThioJoe. It's useless for me, because I rarely get mails, lol
