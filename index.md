# Rudxain @ GH Pages

My username literally means "red & cyan", which are the non-grayscale colors in my [isotype](https://lorartist.com/do-you-know-the-difference-between-logo-isotype-imagotype-and-isologo).
I came up with that name after translating it to multiple languages.

The pronunciation is up to interpretation. It usually sounds similar to "Roxanne", but I suggest "Rod-xaeen"

My "fuller" name is Ricardo Fernández Abud Serrata Cabrera

## I...

- am comfortable with any pronouns, but I may laugh if you call me a "she"
- speak Español and English. I wish I learned an international [conlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language)
- am single, and waiting to meet someone that would change that state
- studied in "Colegio Divina Pastora", "Colegio Jesús En Ti Confío", "Liceo Católico Tecnológico de Barahona", "Universidad Católica Tecnológica de Barahona" (1 semester), "Instituto Tecnológico de Santo Domingo" (only once)
- reply/react to posts regardless of their ⌛date (I'm "ancient-agnostic", lol). [I'm kind of a historian/paleontologist myself](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FFcEIG5WQAgBo33.jpg) XD .
- am against indoctrination/brainwashing, religious and secular alike. I've been a victim of that, and I know how hard it is to break out of the mental prison.
- am anti-dogmatism and anti-faith. Not anti-hope. Not anti-trust.
- am an Adobe, 🍎Apple, Samsung, and Nestlé boycotter. Even if I were rich, I **wouldn't buy a single product** from them, unless I'm *forced* to.
- [am anti-DRM](https://defectivebydesign.org)
- [am pro-adoption, pro-need (not pro-choice), and pro-life (not pro-birth)](https://amptoons.com/blog/?p=13565)
- am anti-sexist and anti-racist, but I can laugh at sexist and racist jokes (I'm not "woke")
- am partially vegan (I consume animal-based products, as least as possible)
- recycle almost anything
- love minimalism, hate redundancy (except when it's necessary)
- want euthanasia. If my body no longer works "good enough", just end my life peacefully.
- want my body to contribute to the ecosystem. So when I die, I don't want to be buried in a coffin. Let my body become nutritious material for plants!

## Deleted accounts

- Google+. Because it died with the social media, lol
- Facebook. Usernames (sorted from oldest to newest): faladagron, faladragon, Bitscardo, RFSgp, RicardoFSerrata, RicardoFernandezSerrata, Rudxain. I only had 1 account, I never forgot the password (unlike other people, lol)
- Instagram. I had many usernames because I **deleted it 3 or 4 times**
- Twitter. It was boring, now it's the opposite!
- Duolingo. I liked it, and completed the full English & Spanish courses with high scores. I learned some Greek, Latin, Esperanto, Portuguese, Japanese Hiragana, Chinese Mandarin, Italian, French, and German. But I forgot about most of them, lol
- Desmos. Saving projects on the cloud is useful, but I realized I don't need it. I prefer WolframAlpha
- Samsung. I just wanted a dark theme on my Galaxy J3 Mission (it had Android 8), so I installed the most "vanilla"/"faithful" theme (I don't remember the name, but it was "high contrast")
- Adobe. They're like Apple, but worse
- SoundCloud (rfs-680354630). I thought I wouldn't need it, because I never uploaded audio
- Newgrounds (RFS-Gamer)
- Frikipedia. Because it died with the website. R.I.P. both
- Cartoon Network. I had many accounts because I was a kid and I always forgot my password, lol. I liked to play as a "toonix" and playing Flash games like the one inspired by "How To Train Your Dragon". I never deleted any of the accounts, but I added it to this list because I forgor 💀 the usernames too, LMAO
- AI Dungeon. They made it worse. IDK if it's better now
- [SayMine](https://saymine.com). I discovered this one thanks to ThioJoe. It's useless for me, because I rarely get mails, lol
