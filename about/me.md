# I...

- am comfortable with any pronouns, but I may laugh if you call me a "she"
- speak Español and English. I wish I learned an international [conlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language)
- am single, and waiting to meet someone that would change that state
- studied in "Colegio Divina Pastora", "Colegio Jesús En Ti Confío", "Liceo Católico Tecnológico de Barahona", "Universidad Católica Tecnológica de Barahona" (1 semester), "Instituto Tecnológico de Santo Domingo" (only once)
- reply/react to posts regardless of their ⌛date (I'm "ancient-agnostic", lol). [I'm kind of a historian/paleontologist myself](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FFcEIG5WQAgBo33.jpg) XD .
- am against indoctrination/brainwashing, religious and secular alike. I've been a victim of that, and I know how hard it is to break out of the mental prison.
- am anti-dogmatism and anti-faith. Not anti-hope. Not anti-trust.
- boycott: Reddit, Adobe, Apple, Samsung, and Nestlé. Even if I were rich, I **wouldn't buy a single product** from them, unless I'm *forced* to.
- [am anti-DRM](https://defectivebydesign.org)
- [am pro-adoption, pro-need (not pro-choice), and pro-life (not pro-birth)](https://amptoons.com/blog/?p=13565)
- am partially vegan (I consume animal-based products, as least as possible)
- recycle almost anything.
- love minimalism, hate bloat.
- want euthanasia. If my body no longer works "good enough", just end my life peacefully.
- want my body to contribute to the ecosystem. So when I die, I don't want to be buried in a coffin. Let my body become nutritious material for plants!
