# Rudxain @ GH Pages

My username literally means "red & cyan", which are the non-grayscale colors in my [isotype](https://lorartist.com/do-you-know-the-difference-between-logo-isotype-imagotype-and-isologo).

## I...

- sleep without pillow... yeah, it's more comfortable.
- reply/react to posts regardless of their ‚åõdate (I'm "ancient-agnostic", lol). [I'm kind of a historian/paleontologist myself](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FFcEIG5WQAgBo33.jpg) XD .
- **‚ù§LOVE** üéµmusic mashups! If you've seen my YT and SC playlists, you'll know I'm **very** serious.
- hate hypocrisy, even my own (if I ever become unintentionally hypocrite).
- like learning, and am skeptical of **myself**. So I'll admit being wrong, if I recognize that I'm wrong, and I'll try my best to find flaws in my reasoning. I'll also thank anyone who corrects me (properly and respectfully). Pseudo-skeptics are *not skeptical of themselves*, they won't accept constructive criticism from anyone.
- am an atheist open to beliefs (as long as they're rational). [More info](https://reddit.com/r/atheism/wiki/faq).
- am not necesarily anti-theist, but I'm definetely against child indoctrination/brainwashing, religious or secular. I've been a victim of that, and I know how hard it is to see reality outside that mental prison.
- like mythology (and religious lore) in general, despite not believing it.
- have the creativity to think about new beliefs, like the "Universe = Dead Deity" hypothesis, and the hypothesis that "deities may exist but none created our universe".
- am not agnostic, because I don't assume that deities are the only kind of transcendental thing that could exist, and I don't assume that transcendental stuff exists. Supernatural stuff can't exist, because it's "unnatural and natural" by definition, making it a contradiction. Transcendental stuff isn't bound by the laws of nature, and therefore, its unfalsifiable potential existence isn't contradictory.
- think religion should be treated like art/entertainment, not a mindset, not a lifestyle.
- am an üçéApple Boycotter. Even if I were rich, I **wouldn't buy a single product** from them, unless I'm *forced* to.
- think abortion should be replaced by adoption. If you ban adoption, you can't ban abortion, otherwise you're a clown ü§°. "pro-life" usually means "pro-birth". The majority doesn't care about the baby's life, they just want it to be born, peak hypocrisy. [Related](https://amptoons.com/blog/?p=13565).
- am anti-sexist. ‚ôÄÔ∏èFeminism is just ‚ôÇÔ∏èMachismo for females. Gender differences shouldn't be ignored, but that doesn't mean we should do unjustified discrimination. There's good (justifiable) and bad (irrational) discrimination, learn the difference, be wiser.
- am anti-racist, but I like some racist jokes, even if it "offends my race".
- am partially vegan, consuming animal-based products as least as possible.
- **recycle almost anything**, as much as possible. However, that may be bad for my health, because I do it with water bottles, so I may be ingesting nano-plastics üò•. I hope graphene becomes mainstream sooner.
- love minimalism, hate redundancy (except when it's truly necessary)
- want euthanasia. If my body no longer works "good enough", just end my life peacefully.
- want my body to contribute to the ecosystem. So when I die, I don't want to be buried in a coffin, let my body serve as nutritious material for plants!
- don't care too much about my birthday (or most "special" dates, for that matter). "Time is relative"

- [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/RFSGameplayer). My custom URL has "RFSGameplayer" because I changed it long ago when YT requisites were lower, now I can't update it to Rudxain lol. I didn't even upload "gameplays" or "let's plays", I just *planned* to do so.
- I have WhatsApp, but I don't want my personal phone number to be public. I'm considering switching to Telegram

- [My Llamalab Automate](https://llamalab.com/automate/community/flows/42921) user ID is #34225, a [JSON containing IDs of all my flows](https://llamalab.com/automate/community/api/v1/users/34225/flows) is available. When I'm not coding JS or some shell lang, I use AM because it offers fast and easy access to Android system APIs. I usually don't automate stuff because I would rather do some stuff manually than to have a background process always consuming the little RAM my device has
- Samsung (I just wanted themes for my Galaxy lol)
- [Roblox profile (RFS_Roblox)](https://www.roblox.com/users/323158352/profile). I only played with my siblings, and I created my account before inventing the "Rudxain" username/alias.
- [TotalJerkFace/FancyForce profile (RFSwerewolf)](https://totaljerkface.com/profile.tjf?uid=6050400). I played Happy Wheels a lot back in the day. My username was inspired by "The Werehog" from the game Sonic Unleashed (very underrated Sega game)
- My Boomlings/RobTop-Games username is "Rudxain" (it was "RFS", before I changed it, now [someone else](https://gdbrowser.com/u/RFS) has that name). [My Geometry Dash profile](https://gdbrowser.com/u/Rudxain). I didn't had the chance to play Boomlings, but I knew about the game before RobTop removed it from G Play Store, all thanks to GD.
- [osu! (RFS_Osu)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9905562). I guess you'll start seeing a pattern here, I **LOVE** music/rhythm games. 1 of my faves isn't mentioned on this list [(Music Racer)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abstractart.music_racer), but I stopped playing it
- My Supercell ID is "Rudxain", and my name in Brawl Stars is "Rudxain null", because apparently "Rudxain" is an *"invalid name"* but **"null" is perfectly valid** according to Supercell. I created my ID because I kinda like Brawl Stars, and I play it with my siblings. I sometimes played Clash of Clans in the past, but played as guest

- Instagram. I had many usernames because I **deleted it 3 or 4 times**

- Newgrounds (RFS-Gamer)
- G+, because it died with the social media
- Frikipedia, also because my account died with the website itself lol

I never deleted any of the accounts, but I added it to this list because I forgor üíÄ the usernames too LMAO
- [SayMine](https://saymine.com). I discovered this one thanks to ThioJoe. It's kinda useless for me because I almost never get any mail, lol
