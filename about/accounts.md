# Accounts
This page has 2 purposes:
- Provide my contact info
- Deter impersonators

If you find a user claiming to be me, but their account doesn't match anything here, it's extremely likely they're lying.

My emails and phones are private, to reduce spam. If you need those addresses, ask privately.

I have 1 public email address, and its username is the exact same as mine (ends with `@gmail.com`).

My personal email addresses **do not contain my name, nickname**, or anything that looks similar to those.

My `*.edu.do` emails **contain my shortened full-name**. Such as my:
- CIC Gmail
- UCATEBA Outlook
