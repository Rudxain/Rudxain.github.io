It literally means "red & cyan", which are the non-grayscale colors in my [isotype](https://lorartist.com/do-you-know-the-difference-between-logo-isotype-imagotype-and-isologo).
I came up with that name after translating it to multiple languages.

The pronunciation is up to interpretation. It usually sounds similar to "Roxanne", but I suggest "Rod-xaeen"

## Real

My "fuller" name would include "Cabrera" and "Abud", as surnames.
