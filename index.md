# Rudxain @ GH Pages

My username literally means "red & cyan", which are the non-grayscale colors in my [isotype](https://lorartist.com/do-you-know-the-difference-between-logo-isotype-imagotype-and-isologo).
I came up with that name after translating it to multiple languages.

The pronunciation is up to interpretation. It usually sounds similar to "Roxanne", but I suggest "Rod-xaeen"

## I...

- am comfortable with any pronouns, but I may laugh if you call me a "she"
- am partially autistic
- speak Español and English. I wish I learned an international [conlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language)
- don't like pillows
- am single, and waiting to meet someone that would change that state
- reply/react to posts regardless of their ⌛date (I'm "ancient-agnostic", lol). [I'm kind of a historian/paleontologist myself](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FFcEIG5WQAgBo33.jpg) XD .
- **LOVE** music/rhythm games. 1 of my faves was [Music Racer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abstractart.music_racer)
- hate hypocrisy, even my own (if I ever become unintentionally hypocrite (i.e. cognitive dissonance)).
- like learning, and am skeptical of **myself**. So I'll admit being wrong, if I recognize that I'm wrong, and I'll try my best to find flaws in my reasoning. I'll also thank anyone who corrects me (properly and respectfully). Pseudo-skeptics are *not skeptical of themselves*, they won't accept constructive criticism from anyone.
- am an atheist open to beliefs (as long as they're rational). [More info](https://reddit.com/r/atheism/wiki/faq).
- am not necesarily anti-theist, but I'm definetely against child indoctrination/brainwashing, religious or secular. I've been a victim of that, and I know how hard it is to see reality outside that mental prison.
- like mythology (and religious lore) in general, despite not believing it.
- have the creativity to think about new beliefs, like the "Universe = Dead Deity" hypothesis, and the hypothesis that "deities may exist but none created our universe".
- am not agnostic, because I don't assume that deities are the only kind of transcendental thing that could exist, and I don't assume that transcendental stuff exists. Supernatural stuff can't exist, because it's "unnatural and natural" by definition, making it a contradiction. Transcendental stuff isn't bound by the laws of nature, and therefore, its unfalsifiable potential existence isn't contradictory.
- think religion should be treated like art/entertainment, not a mindset, not a lifestyle.
- am an 🍎Apple Boycotter. Even if I were rich, I **wouldn't buy a single product** from them, unless I'm *forced* to.
- think abortion should be replaced by adoption. If you ban adoption, you can't ban abortion, otherwise you're a clown 🤡. "pro-life" usually means "pro-birth". The majority doesn't care about the baby's life, they just want it to be born, peak hypocrisy. [Related](https://amptoons.com/blog/?p=13565).
- am anti-sexist. ♀️Feminism is just ♂️Machismo for females. Gender differences shouldn't be ignored, but that doesn't mean we should do unjustified discrimination. There's good (justifiable) and bad (irrational) discrimination, learn the difference, be wiser.
- am anti-racist, but I like some racist jokes, even if it "offends my race".
- am partially vegan, consuming animal-based products as least as possible.
- **recycle almost anything**, as much as possible. However, that may be bad for my health, because I do it with water bottles, so I may be ingesting nano-plastics 😥. I hope [graphene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene) becomes mainstream sooner.
- love minimalism, hate redundancy (except when it's truly necessary)
- am kinda interested in psychology and philosophy
- want euthanasia. If my body no longer works "good enough", just end my life peacefully.
- want my body to contribute to the ecosystem. So when I die, I don't want to be buried in a coffin, let my body serve as nutritious material for plants!
- don't care too much about my birthday (or most "special" dates, for that matter). "Time is relative"
